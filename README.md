# plotMARC

A command line tool to visually characterise a bibliographic collection in terms of publication dates and available bibliographic identifier coverage.

## Basic usage

From a directory containing one or more binary [MARC21](https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/) format for bibliographic data files (with extension `.mrc`)
representing a bibliographic collection, run:

    ./plotMARC.py
    
The script will process the MARC files using [pymarc](https://gitlab.com/pymarc/pymarc),
and produce a single `<directoryname>.png` image containing a 3-way Venn diagram displaying the number of records with the following bibliographic identifiers:
  
* ISBN
* OCN ([OCLC](https://www.oclc.org/) number)
* LCCN ([Library of Congress](https://loc.gov/) number)
  
and a histogram showing the publication dates in the bib records.

### Example output
